ptex2pdf.lua
============

Convert Japanese TeX documents to pdf

Author: Norbert Preining <norbert@preining.info>

Main purpose of the script is easy support of Japanese typesetting
engines in TeXworks. As TeXworks typesetting setup does not allow
for multistep processing, this script runs one of the ptex based
programs (ptex, uptex, eptex, platex, uplatex) followed by dvipdfmx.

Usage
-----
[texlua] ptex2pdf[.lua] { option | basename[.tex] } ... 
options: -v  version
         -h  help
         -e  use eptex class of programs
         -u  use uptex class of programs
         -l  use latex based formats
         -s  stop at dvi
         -i  retain intermediate files
         -ot '<opts>' extra options for TeX
         -od '<opts>' extra options for dvipdfmx


Installation
------------

Copy the file ptex2pdf.lua into a directory where scripts are found,
that is for example
  TLROOT/texmf-dist/scripts/ptex2pdf/
(where TLROOT is for example the root of your TeX Live installation)

Unix:
create a link in one of the bin dirs to the above file, in the
TeX Live case:
  TLROOT/bin/ARCH/ptex2pdf -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/ptex2pdf/ptex2pdf.lua

Windows:
create a copy of runscript.exe as ptex2pdf.exe, in the TeX Live case:
  copy TLROOT/bin/win32/runscript.exe TLROOT/bin/win32/ptex2pdf.exe



TeXworks setup
--------------
Under Preferences > Typesetting add new entries, for example:

for ptex files:
  Name:         pTeX to pdf
  Program:      ptex2pdf
  Arguments:    -ot
                $synctexoption
                $fullname

for platex files:
  Name:         pLaTeX to pdf
  Program:      ptex2pdf
  Arguments:    -l
                -ot
                $synctexoption
                $fullname

for uptex files:
  Name:         upTeX to pdf
  Program:      ptex2pdf
  Arguments:    -u
                -ot
                $synctexoption
                $fullname

for uplatex files:
  Name:         upLaTeX to pdf
  Program:      ptex2pdf
  Arguments:    -l
                -u
                -ot
                $synctexoption
